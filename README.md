Little project to understand MVC design pattern with ASP.Net core and others.

## Project Description
This is project was done with the intention to understand the following:
  - Understand MVC design pattern.
  - Get familiarized with ASP.NET core and refresh C# sintaxis.
  - Understand Scaffolding, CRUD, routing/mapping, relation to the Views with actual HTML and CSS as a front end.
  - Understand data base management with Entity Framework since EF Core is intended to be used with .NET Core applications.
  - Add aditional features.
  - Understand ObjectMapper and what it implies (such as: Creation of classes, creating an object that uses previously defined classes, use the object to retrieve data, etc.).
 
## How to Install and Run the Project
Simply export all the files. I used Visual Studio Code and launch the application using Go Live function. If one would like to use this project as a reference, make sure to follow the link mentioned in Credits and to install all required packages such as dotnet, ef, etc, that are mentioned along the tutorial.
                
## How to use the project
As mentioned, there is no specific use rather than testing and understanding MVC.  Feel free to playaround with requests and modify other things.

## Future possible enhancements
Since main functionality is already done, possible improvements would be to implement a Bootstrap template for a better user interface.
