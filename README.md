Notes:

# Comment 1
It can be seen that within Shared Views there is the _Layout.cshtml.css which is the css file to be desplayed when running the application. 
It appears in the _ViewStart.cshtml, which sets a default css to be displayed when running. When running the application the Shared parts gets rendered
first, and after it renders the correspondent view.

# Comment 2
The launchSettings.json within the Properties folders, sets which port of the localhost will be used.
